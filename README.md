## How to compile the code? 
  - 1. First, run [R/get_stability_with_envdata.Rmd](https://github.com/sghosh89/WP2/blob/main/R/get_stability_with_envdata.Rmd), it will save the csv file in the `Results` folder. The csv file is necessary for path analysis in the next step.
  - 2. [stability_metric_and_env_all.csv](https://github.com/sghosh89/WP2/blob/main/Results/stability_metric_and_env_all.csv) is already uploaded in `Results` folder, so you can skip step 1.
  - 3. you can get preliminary reports with further analysis from [R/Preliminary_report.Rmd](https://github.com/sghosh89/WP2/blob/main/R/Preliminary_report.Rmd)
  - 4. Related manuscript can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M7gtw6sqevFitQbTDMenyVRQWrLsBUkQ).
