The monthlyvalues timeseries files for tas, tasmax, tasmin, pr are extracted from 
CHELSA version 2.1: (https://chelsa-climate.org/timeseries/), the codes to download and 
extract monthly data are not included in this repo. I did it in my external hard drive
because of too large files.

Then we extracted the annual value (avg over 12 months) from monthly values files - 
codes are given in R/wrangling_env_data.R
