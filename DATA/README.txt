We have downloaded the community timeseries data  from here:

	Project BioDyn: compilation of long-term (>20yrs) community timeseries data from terrestrial and 
	freshwater realms [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8233591


	The above dataset are arranged into 7 subfolders:
	for BBS, for_BioTIME, for_BioTIMEx, for_swisslake, for_RivFishTIME, for_zoop_2014, for_insectRoel2020

	For our analysis, we considered annual abundance timeseries (1979-2019) for 
	a total of 1,826 communities: birds (n=1,246) and fish (n=580). Data for other taxa were 
	not sufficient enough to carry out the structural equation modeling. 
	A metadata summary for those 1,826 communities	is provided as a csv file.


For climate data: see folders "CHELSA_v2", "wrangled_env_data". 

For data related to species' tolerance limits see folder "STI_related".

Though we have not used the traits data (body-measurements) for birds and fish in our analysis, 
"traitsdata" folder contains info to resolve the confusion for species names (scientific names, 
common names, names appeared in the present community data).
