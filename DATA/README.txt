Project BioDyn: compilation of long-term (>20yrs) community timeseries data from terrestrial and 
freshwater realms [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8233591


The above dataset originally had 2,668 community timeseries data arranged into 7 subfolders:
for BBS, for_BioTIME, for_BioTIMEx, for_swisslake, for_RivFishTIME, for_zoop_2014, for_insectRoel2020

For our analysis, we considered annual abundance timeseries (1979-2019) for 
a total of 1,826 communities: birds (n=1,246) and fish (n=580). A metadata summary for these 1,826 communities
is provided as a csv file.
