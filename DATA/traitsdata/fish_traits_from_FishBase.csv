Most abundant in backwaters, lower parts of slow-flowing rivers, brackish estuaries and warm and shallow lakes (Ref. 59043).  Adults occur usually in still and slow-running waters where they travel in large shoals (Ref. 9696).  Larvae and juveniles live in still water bodies, feeding on plankton. One to two years old juveniles move from backwaters to river to feed. In the absence of opportunity to leave backwaters, juveniles may adapt but have a slower growth and attain maturity at a smaller size.  They also drift to brackishwater estuaries to forage when water level of flooded areas drops in lower reaches of large rivers. Foraging juveniles in brackish waters stay in lower parts of rivers to overwinter in freshwater (Ref. 59043).  Feed on insects, particularly chironomids, small crustaceans, mollusks and plants.  Larger specimens may feed on small fish.  Juveniles feed on zooplankton (Ref. 30578).  Able to shift to particle feeding or even filter feeding at high zooplankton abundance.  Usually spawn in backwaters, floodplains or lakes shores with dense vegetation (Ref. 59043).  Can survive out of the water for extended periods (Ref. 9988).

Naturally found only in water bodies connected to the sea (Ref. 59043). Territorial and solitary species; 'schools' of young eels which are observed from time to time are a mass response to outward conditions and not of active assembling (Ref. 172). Amphihaline (Ref. 51442). Migrates to the depths of the Sargasso Sea to spawn (Ref. 172, 51442). Eel larvae (leptocephali) are transparent ribbon-like. They are brought to the coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream in 7 to 11 months time (Ref. 51442) and can last for up to 3 years (Ref. 8994). They are transformed into glass eels (6-8 cm length, cylindrical in shape and transparent to slightly pigmented in colour). They enter the estuaries and colonize rivers and lakes (Ref. 11941, 51442); some individuals remain in estuaries and coastal waters to grow into adults (Ref. 88171). The glass eel stage is followed by a long feeding period (from the yellow to the silver eel stage) lasting 6-12 years in males (Ref. 6125) and 9-20 years in females (Ref. 6125). Yellow and silver eels are benthic, found under stones, buried in the mud or in crevices (Ref. 89138). Yellow eels eventually lose their pigmentation, becoming dark dorsally and silver ventrally (called silver eels). Silver eels are also characterized by a clear contrasting black lateral line and enlarged eyes (Ref. 6125). At the end of their growth period, they become sexually mature, migrate to the sea and cover great distances during their spawning migration (5,000-6,000 km); with extensive daily vertical migrations between 200 m at night and 600 m during day time, possibly for predator avoidance (Ref. 89140). Gametogenesis occurs entirely during spawning migration. Average life span is usually 15-20 years (Ref. 88171). Male eels can grow up to 50 cm TL (Ref. 39903). Occurs at temperatures ranging from 0-30°C (Ref. 172). Its food includes virtually the whole aquatic fauna (freshwater as well as marine) occurring in the eel's area, augmented with animals living out of water, e.g. worms (Ref. 172). Best temperature for making eels sexually mature is 20-25°C (Ref. 35388). Sensitive to weak magnetic fields (Ref. 89141, 89142). Their high fat content and benthic feeding habits in continental waters make them vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants, that may result in organ damage and impaired migration capability (Ref. 82710) and lowered genetic variability (Ref. 82711). Review of information supports the view that the European eel population as a whole has declined in most areas, the stock is outside safe biological limits and current fisheries not sustainable (Ref. 82712). Obvious decreasing of the stocks for all the continental native distribution area (Ref. 40476).

Larvae and early juveniles prey on small invertebrates while larger juveniles and adults feed on benthic diatoms and detritus.  Adults migrate upstream some tens of km to spawning sites which are often located in tributaries.  Spawning occurs in fast flowing water on shallow gravel beds (Ref. 556, 59043).  Its flesh is good but bony (Ref. 30578).  Locally threatened by damming, destruction of spawning sites and pollution.  In drainages where they are introduced, they outcompete and eliminate <i>Parachondrostoma toxostoma</i> in Rhône and <i>Protochondrostoma genei</i> in Soca (Ref. 59043).","Chondrostoma nasus"

Conditions for spawning include high current (0.5-1.7 m/s), turbid water, temperatures above 15°C (usually 18-26°C)  and high oxygen concentrations (Ref. 59043).  Spawning ceases if conditions change (especially sensitive to water-level fall) and resumes again when water level increases.  Juveniles and adults form large schools during spawning season.  Mature individuals undertake long distance upriver migration at start of a rapid flood and water-level increase, able to leap over obstacles up to 1 m.  After spawning, adults migrate to foraging habitats,  In autumn, adults move to deeper places in main course of river where they remain without feeding.  Larvae drift downstream and settle in floodplain lakes, shallow shores and backwaters with little or no current (Ref. 59043).  In aquaculture, it can survive brackish water (up to 7 ppt) when released into estuaries and coastal lakes (Ref. 59043).  Escape from fish farms are widely known even as they are stocked in large rivers and almost all still water bodies like lakes and ponds.  Utilized fresh for human consumption and also introduced to many countries where its ability to clean reservoirs and other waters of clogging algae is appreciated even more than its food value (Ref. 9987).

Oviparous (Ref. 205).  Females spawn for the first time at the end of the first year and spawning lasts up to 3 years but with most females dying at the end of the first spawning year.  One female spawns up to 1,200 eggs (usually 200-300) in a single layer under a large stone; spawns several egg portions during the season. On the other hand, the males clean, fan and defend the eggs until hatching.  Several females may spawn with one male, which may guard the eggs at different stages of development (Ref. 59043).  Eggs are demersal and adhesive; eggs hatch in about a week (Ref. 205, 59043).  Planktonic larvae until about 1.5 cm, are drifted to and remain in quiet pools or side arms of rivers (Ref. 59043). Populations are threatened due to pollution and water abstraction (Ref. 26100); most riverine populations affected by habitat alteration (especially siltation and alteration of stream morphology), and predation of exotic species.

Occurs in lakes and rocky runs and pools of small to large rivers (Ref. 86798).  Some landlocked populations exist. Found in all rivers where temperature rises above 10° C for about 3 months per year and does not exceed 20° C for more than a few weeks in summer (Ref. 59043) (preferred temperatures 4-12°C). Juveniles may live in cold lakes in northern Europe (Ref. 59043). Parr (i.e. juveniles) are territorial and are found in the upper reaches of rivers and streams, in riffle areas with strong current and rough gravel bottoms (Ref. 7471). During winter, parr seek refuge in small spaces or under stones during the day (Refs. 59043, 89461). Young remain in freshwater for 1 to 6 years, then migrate to coastal marine waters or even to open oceans where they remain for 1 to 4 years before returning to freshwater  for spawning (Ref. 51442). Adults inhabit cooler waters with strong to moderate flow (Ref. 44894). The Atlantic salmon is reported to live up to 10 years, but most individuals only reach 4-6 years (Ref. 88187). Juveniles feed mainly on aquatic insects, mollusks, crustaceans and fish; adults at sea feed on squids, shrimps, and fish (Ref. 51442). Most populations depend mostly or exclusively on stocking due to degradations of environmental conditions.  Fishing pressure on wild stocks has decreased due to intensive farming but other problems have increased. Farmed salmons escape in large numbers and move to any river and hybridize with wild stocks (Ref. 59043). This species may hybridize with trout (Salmo trutta) (Ref. 59043). Diseases of the species include furunculosis (Aeromonas salmonicida), corynebacterial kidney disease (Renibacterium salmoninarum), enteric red mouth disease (Yersinia ruckeri), infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, bacterial kidney disease, fin rot and fungus infections (Ref. 5951).

Lacustrine populations undertake migration to tributaries and lake outlets to spawn, rarely spawning on stone, wave-washed lake shores.  Spawns in rivers and streams with swift current, usually characterized by downward movement of water intro gravel (Ref. 59043).  Spawning takes place normally more than one time (Ref. 51442).
