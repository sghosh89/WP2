# Introduction

*The following text originally came from the Ghosh UZH UFO application*

As the global climate is experiencing more heat, and less rainfall - it is reasonable to expect that the distributions of these variables (temperature and rainfall) are becoming more skewed and asymmetric towards the extreme values (see figure \@ref(fig:introduction-figure) below, which comes from the UZH UFO proposal, where it was figure 2). With the availability of more open access long-term databases, it is possible to address how different taxa respond at the community level.

As a preliminary work, I have already gathered long-term (median of 41 years) species-level abundance data for 2043 terrestrial and 716 aquatic communities. My recent result (manuscript in preparation) shows that the community stability is different for terrestrial and freshwater taxa and could be better explained considering the different strengths between pairwise species associations at the extremes, called community-level tail association, than with classic correlates of community stability studies (richness and variance ratio).

I will gather global data for annual temperature and rainfall from open access CHELSA database19 and ask how variability in temperature and precipitation would affect terrestrial taxa (birds, mammals, invertebrates, plants). For freshwater taxa (fish, phytoplankton, invertebrates), mostly temperature variability would be considered. In marine realm, sampling is spatially not consistent over the years20 and also very few long-term (>20yrs) data sampled compared to terrestrial and freshwater, thus I will focus only on the latter two realms. Also, species-level biomass (or body size) data will be gathered considering different generation times across taxa.

I will focus on community stability and will build a Bayesian model incorporating climatic factors (e.g., variability, skewness, range of maximum and minimum of temperature-distribution over the years etc.). While scientists studied thermophilization in the context of warming-related turnover in communities, no predictive model for community stability has been developed, to date, assessing the effect of extreme climatic events across taxa using a global database. This study will inform the current status of communities across multiple taxa facing climatic extremes and help prioritize conservation efforts (see Work Package 2).

I will gather annual climate data (mean, minimum, maximum for temperature, rainfall) and compute the variability, and the skewness of their distribution for the study period over which the community dynamics was studied. I will compute the richness (number of total species and dominant species that were present minimum 70% of the total years sampled), variance ratio, community level total tail association from pairwise synchrony as drivers. These drivers appeared as significant for explaining variation in community stability from my recent study (manuscript in preparation). I will compute the response variable community stability as the inverse of community-variability over the study period. Then, I will build a Bayesian model to see the effect of climate parameters, on the stability-driver relationships for different taxa.
